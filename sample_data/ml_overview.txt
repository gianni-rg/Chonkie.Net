Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions on unseen data. 
Unsupervised learning identifies patterns in data without pre-existing labels or categories. 
Reinforcement learning trains agents to make sequential decisions by rewarding desired behaviors. 
Feature engineering transforms raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem.
