Artificial Intelligence represents the simulation of human intelligence by machines. 
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. 
Natural Language Processing allows computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.
