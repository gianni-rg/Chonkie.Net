This folder contains intermediate implementation plans and status documents that have been superseded by completion reports.

## Archived Files

### C# 14 & .NET 10 Enhancement Planning

These files were used during the C# 14 and .NET 10 enhancement implementation (Phases 1-5). They are now superseded by the completion report.

- **CSHARP14_EXTENSION_MEMBERS_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Initial implementation guide for Phase 1
- **CSHARP14_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md** - Status tracking during Phases 1-3
- **DOTNET10_CSHARP14_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md** - Original comprehensive enhancement plan
- **DOTNET10_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Implementation guide for all phases
- **PHASE4_TENSORPRIMITIVES_PLAN.md** - Phase 4 TensorPrimitives migration plan

**Current Documentation:** See [../CSHARP14_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md](../CSHARP14_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md) and [../TENSORPRIMITIVES_PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md](../TENSORPRIMITIVES_PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md)

### ONNX Embeddings Implementation

These files were used during the ONNX Sentence Transformers implementation.

- **ONNX_EMBEDDINGS_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md** - Development plan for ONNX embeddings
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Intermediate implementation summary

**Current Documentation:** See [../ONNX_MODEL_CONVERSION_GUIDE.md](../ONNX_MODEL_CONVERSION_GUIDE.md) and the ONNX section in [../../IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md](../../IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md)

## Why Archive?

These documents provided valuable planning and tracking during active development but are now historical. They are retained for:

1. **Historical Reference** - Understanding the development process
2. **Decision Documentation** - Why certain approaches were chosen
3. **Learning Resource** - How large features were planned and executed
